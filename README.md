# frontend-battle-hackathon
This project is a fully frontend interactive diamond-themed showcase built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, created as part of a hackathon challenge. It focuses on animations, transitions, and scroll-based effects to provide a smooth and modern user experience.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5 – Semantic markup for structure

CSS3 – Custom styling with responsive design and animations

JavaScript (Vanilla) – DOM manipulation and custom animation logic

Netlify – For hosting and live preview

⚠️ No frameworks, libraries, or backend – just clean, native frontend code.

🎯 Hackathon Functionalities Implemented
🖼️ Carousel Image Switch
Auto-switching image carousel that transitions between different content blocks.

Each slide includes title, subtitle, background movement, and a dynamic number display.

Smooth transitions using CSS and setInterval().

🌀 Parallax Scroll Animation
Scroll-based transformation for the hero section.

Elements move at different speeds to create a parallax depth effect.

Responsive and fluid using window.scrollY.

✨ Explore Section Animation
Interactive section that updates title, image, subtitle, and number in sync.

Background shapes, lines, and overlays animate with each switch.

Progress bar and dots reflect the current slide visually.

👥 Customer Showcase (Client Logos)
Animated grid of customer logos (e.g., Figma, Notion, Framer).

Cycles through sets of logos every few seconds.

Uses setInterval() and fade-in/fade-out effects for smooth updates.

📊 Graph & Statistics Display
(If included in your project) Visual metrics and counters to represent performance.

Scroll-activated reveal effects and transitions.
